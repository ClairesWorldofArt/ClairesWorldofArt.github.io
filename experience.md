##Experience:

I have worked with a lot of artistic mediums, from your basic pencil work, to clay work and painting; in-fact whatever materials you may be able to think of, I just may have used it for some kind of artwork. As with anyone, we all find the right kind of art method that works for us, or you like using more than the other methods. What I love about mixed-media is that I can blend these methods into a single piece or create a range, based around a central theme, expressed through many individual pieces.

When it comes to art, we all have our own way of doing things, for me I learned that I like painting, mainly using acrylic paints, water colours and oils. I also like using clay sometimes, but since not being in college and not having a huge space to work in, I do struggle to find time for clay.

Before I’m making some kind of art work, I like to think how I am going to start with the artwork, what kind of style, or combination of styles I am going to target; what materials I will need, including if I am going to add anything into the art work, such as string to make a tree or flowers outline, PVA glue, beads and crystals or textured materials such as wood and sand.

I have even used wallpaper in my art before, along with tea bags, for the back ground of some art work that I have done, leaves and flowers. I get lots of ideas of adding different media into my work, to make them as eye-catching, exciting, interesting and unique as I can.

Moving from doing the kind of art work, academically encouraged, and I am used to, such as trees, flowers and so on, I am now starting to think of focusing on other subjects for my art work that I have not done before like getting into fairy art, or different styles, such as gothic inspired art; and at doing something with fab stuff called bubble-wrap. Sometime soon, I hope I’m going to do a big canvas piece, and it will be fun putting the paint onto it, seeing what comes out.
