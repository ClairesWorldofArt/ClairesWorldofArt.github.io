## Info:

### Payment methods
We can currently only accept payment via paypal, and bank transfer.
With all costs are to be met by the customer when purchasing.

I sell print-reproductions of my work at £50per art work. Anything on canvas will be more, you can see how much by the price under the photo of my work for originals. Delivery is typically 7-10 working days for mainland UK, elsewhere please enquire.

### Terms and Conditions
All works are sent special delivery, with all prints being sent insured. Any work that I have undertaken, and sent to you, that you have paid for and you’re not happy with the condition received in, you will have 7-days to notify me of any complaint(s) about in writing.

For printed works, the process is quite simple. Firstly I will need a letter detailing what your issue(s) are, which you must give me 14-days to read and respond to in writing.

If the complaint is about quality, you must give me an opportunity to replace the works, and send back the piece at issue, along with the complaint.

After trying to resolve issues, if we cannot come to a suitable resolution a refund for the artwork would be issued after return of the artwork in the condition sent! The care of the artwork, if original or print, would be your responsibility, any damages to framing, or the artworks themselves, would be deductible from any amounts already received, which is why we send everything insured and recorded.

*Cost of communications, postage and freight are non-refundable.*
