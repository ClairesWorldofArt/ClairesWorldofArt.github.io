## About:
Hi, Welcome to Claire’s World Of Art,

Art is my passion; it is what I love doing since I was a kid from making hand prints, to just making one big mess, that was fun to make. As I have grown up learning more about art, and seeing what kind of art is out there; I have enjoyed how it can make you feel, just by looking at what you, or someone else has done. Art can make you feel happy, and inspired by the artist as much as the artwork.

I have studied for two years in college for a BTEC Diploma in Art & Design, focusing mainly on mixed media skill’s, where I learned to use many artists methods, as well as using them in more than one way. On this course I learned which methods I prefer to others, and how to combine them to create my own unique art.

When I was in college, I really threw myself into everything I did; this included entering a BP Contest, where I received the prestigious honour of coming 2nd runner up for the art work I did. For the contest the subject was green carbon footprint art, to include the BP logo. I really enjoyed what I created and I am glad to have placed at all.

I am very shy, and sometimes struggle to translate my passion into words, so please enjoy the visual pictures, progress and if you want, enquire about your purchasing an existing, or your own bespoke work by me.
